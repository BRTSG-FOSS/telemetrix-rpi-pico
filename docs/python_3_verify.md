# Verifying The Python Version

Python 3.7 or greater is required before installing and running this package.

To check that you have the correct version of Python 3 installed,
open a command window and type:

```
python3 -V
```

For Windows, you may need to type:

```
python -V
```

The Python version will be displayed:

```
python3

For Windows users, this may look something like this:
```
